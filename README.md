Role-playing games are kind of "Let's pretend", you all play around a table, using your
imaginations to tell a story.

Players play as Characters in the game - and you describe what your
Character says and does.

You can say exactly what you want to say, get your Character to attempt to do whatever you
want them to do, and the Game Master, Facilitator, Referee, Keeper or whatever is
there to tell you what happens next.

When you want your Character to act in  the game, the Game Master will sometimes
get you to roll dice, draw cards or spend tokens to see if your Character succeeds or fails
in what they are trying to do.

A game can last as little as two or three hours, but you might want to play a for
longer. Weeks, months or maybe years.
